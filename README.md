# Maine-Affordability-Web-Scraper
Obtains data on housing and rental affordability across the state of Maine through the use of web scraping and then presents it in a visually appealing format.
The goal of this project is to communicate the most up-to-date information regarding Maine's Affordability Index through an easier and more accessible way by presenting it in a visually pleasing method. Information is first presented for the state as a whole, and is then broken down by county, and then by town. Government websites are used to ensure the data presented is official and always up-to-date.
